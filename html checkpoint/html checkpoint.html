                    Passionate about science and technology and policy related matters. Striving to orient my career towards web development. Continuously looking for new opportunities in order to enlarge my knowledge and improve my skills. Effective communicator to both my colleagues and my students. 
                    In short I am a scientist floating into web development.

                <h2 class='first'> Academic background and work </h2>
                <p class='first'>I graduated with my bachelor’s degree in physics in 2019 and now 
                    I’m finishing my master’s degree in the field. I worked as a tutor for undergraduate students in which I created customized learning paths and personalized learning for my students and helped them reach their academic goals, maintained records for each of them and used collected data to analyze their academic progress. During my degree I did a lot of computational physics like simplifying complex physical phenomena with simulation and modelling in Python and Matlab and I have always found myself into coding and extremely excited about the creation process and now I want to build my own blog since I'm particularly interested in new methodologies allowing teaching complex topics to a large audience. It is one of the reasons why I’m shifting towards web development.
